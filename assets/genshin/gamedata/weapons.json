But cold-blooded creatures ever seek the promised land of warmth.\nTo see his people's dreams fulfilled, Omikami challenged the gathering storm clouds to war.\nAmongst the people of Watatsumi bent upon conquest, a young man stood out from the rest.\nHis fearless valor won him great love in Watatsumi, and they named him Touzannou.\nBut after many years passed, his kingly name was forgotten, only to be replaced by the epithet by which his foes knew him:\n\"Akuou,\" the wicked fangs and claws of the Great Serpent, the savage, demonic invader of Yashiori Island...\n\nThe slaughter had hardened the young man into a warrior. But to him,\nOnly the wish he made before departing, a wish made upon the moon reflected in the waters beside the shrine, was eternal.\n\n\"One day, I shall set myself above Mt. Yougou, overlooking the palace of the Lord of Thunder.\"\n\"I will have a joyful showdown against the legendary Great Tengu of Yougou upon the roof of Tenshukaku.\"\n\"...And then I'll bring that tengu's mask back to Ayame and Mouun as a souvenir!\"\n\nAt last, the tides washed all their dreams away like towers in the sand.\nThe tengu's mask, shining like a crimson star, was shattered like seashore gravel amidst the chaotic battle,\nNor would the shrine maiden who shone like moonlight into the young man's soul ever return again,\nWhile the Akuou himself would face the blinding ray of lightning alongside the Great Serpent.",

At their deepest point, the mines reached all the way to the earth's core.\nSlowly, the once-quiet region was beset by increasingly frequent disturbances. With a deep growl, the earth would tremble, causing landslides on the mountains and cave-ins in the mines.\nIn the night, the aggrieved souls of the innocent who died in the disasters could be heard wailing in the distance.\n\nThen one day, a stranger arrived at Mt. Qingce.\nThe stranger was dressed in a full-length gown and spoke in an esoteric and eloquent manner. He claimed to be a thaumaturge visiting Liyue on a quest to find two craftsmen by the names of Yun and Han.\nYun Huang, the first daughter of the Yun family, was then resident in Qingce Village. She immediately sent a messenger to fetch Han Ce, first son of master craftsman Han Wu.\nThe thaumaturge informed them both that in the past, the Yuns and Hans had jointly crafted a catalyst for the thaumaturges of the world.\nWith unrest now spreading through Liyue, the thaumaturges wished to provide the Yuns and Hans with a piece of crimson Cor Purum, in the hope that it might help the people of Liyue through this troubled time.\n\nOn receiving the message, Yun Huang and Han Ce lit the furnace at once and crafted a blackcliff catalyst with the crimson Pur Lapis at its core.\nThe crimson stone resonated with the ley lines of the earth. A blood-red glow would fade in and out as if to give forewarning of imminent tectonic activity.\nJust as the stars guide those who travel by night, so this catalyst was the light that gave safe passage to the people of Liyue through that tumultuous time of landslides and cave-ins.

But it is one that the bladesmith must overcome if he is to free himself from the shackles that bind him and reach new heights of competency in his trade.\nHan Wu struggled to see beyond the limits of his casting techniques. Thanks to a contact of his good friend in the house of Yun, he was able to go with a crew to the Chasm to personally procure the materials for his new weapon.\nBut a cave-in trapped the crew in the mine shaft for four days.\n\nImprisoned within the impenetrable rock walls of the cave, the crew found their mining tools to be of no use.\nDeprived of all natural light and thus of all knowledge as to the time of day, one by one the trapped crew succumbed to madness and despair.\nJust when they thought all hope was lost, Han Wu thought he saw a faint flickering emanate from the corner of the cave, where lay the prototype sword he had brought with him into the mine.\nWith that sword he carved their way to freedom, and the survivors emerged from the pits of the earth into glorious bright sunlight. But the moment that the first ray of sunlight made contact with the blade, it shattered into a million pieces.\nAll strength left the master craftsman's legs and he collapsed on the ground. Months later, he remade the sword and declared, \"This sword shall be named the Blackcliff Longsword, for it is made of blackcliff.\"\nAll who beheld the Blackcliff Longsword were bewitched by its beauty, spellbound by its sharpness, and transfixed by its tenacity.\nBut the crew spoke not a word of what they had witnessed during their ordeal in the mine...\n\nDeep in the all-consuming darkness, when the master craftsman struck his blade against the cave wall with all his might, the sword released a deafening roar, like thunder sweeping across the plains.\nPerhaps the crew knew that the sword's cry was to foreshadow an earthquake years into the future...",

It zaps through the air like lightning, unimpeded by the wind.\nMade from blackcliff crystal from head to tip, the body is inlaid with red jade stones for decoration.\nViewed in the moonlight, the swirling of blood-red light can be discerned within.\n\nLiyue master craftsman Han Wu had a son with his first wife. The son's name was \"Han Ce, the Cold and Calculating.\" Cold, because his father wished him to be cool-headed and rational. Calculating, because his father wished him to be precise in his craft, that he might inherit the family business.\nBut Han Ce had other ambitions. During his days as a student, Han Ce idled away his study time on martial arts fiction, while spending his free time practicing the art of the polearm up in the mountains. He was consumed by the desire to become a martial nomad, roaming the world with his pole for protection.\nWhen he scoured the lands in search of Aerosiderite, he sought not the rare ore itself but the thrill of adventure. And when he ascended the highest peaks to commune with the adepti, he desired not the wisdom of the sages but the tale of his travels.\nHan Ce cared not for the flames of the furnace and the working of weaponry. His father scolded him, but it was to no avail. Eventually, Han Ce left home one day without bidding his father farewell.\n\nIn his later years, Han Wu was involved in a mining accident that profoundly changed his temperament. Han Ce caught wind of the ordeal and hurried home to see his father, traveling through the night.\nPreviously hot-tempered and never short of something to say, Han Wu was now calm and quiet. He no longer held any animosity towards his son for his reluctance to take over the forge.\nFinally, father and son grew close for the first time in their lives. Han Ce was ashamed of his past actions, but knew not how to redeem himself.\nSeveral years later, Han Wu breathed his last. Thus ended the life of the master craftsman of a generation. Per his father's will, Han Ce retrieved an archive of weapon designs from the study — they were the fabled prototypes.\nThe archive was sealed inside a wooden chest along with a letter addressed to Han Ce.\n\"To my dear son, Han Ce. The world is vast and filled with many marvels. May you always see the wonder in the world, wherever your journey takes you.\"\n\nThe designs were covered in comments penned by his father. Han Ce was overjoyed at the sight and proceeded to peruse them all night long.\nAs Han Ce stepped outside the door of the study at the first light of dawn, he watched in wonder as a meteorite fell from the sky. It crashed down right before him in front of the Han residence, landing perfectly vertical.\nA host of emotions flooded Han Ce's heart. Tears both of joy and sorrow streamed down his face as he cried, \"The heavens have spoken! The heavens have spoken!\"\nHan Ce took the pitch-black aerosiderite and added it to the blackcliff that remained in the forge. Following his late father's designs to the letter, he crafted a pointed pole with a sharp tip that shimmered like ice and a body hard as bedrock.\nHan Ce could have traveled the world with this trusty weapon in hand, but he chose not to. For Han Ce vowed that starting that day, never again would the flames of the furnace die out, and never again would the working of weaponry cease.",

    "lore": "A broadsword wrought from rare blackcliff. Weighty as a boulder, it has enough brute force to carve its way through a mountain.\nThe blade is forged from a combination of blackcliff crystal and a crimson ore. It is pitch black like a pool of ink, with red flames leaping from within.\n\nBlackcliff weaponry has its roots in the ancient \"prototype\" series. Blackcliff blades possess three distinguishing features: hard as bedrock, shimmer like ice, fierce as the blood that gives us life.\nThough the Slasher is a broadsword, it has a uniquely sharp blade, barely thicker than a thread of silk.\nThe join between the red and black crystals is seamless, and each blade segment interlocks perfectly with the next to form a single cohesive body.\nWith the flame motif and red jade stones that adorn the hilt, the sword has a dark and foreboding presence when viewed from afar, like bright-red blood oozing from a bottomless pit of black ink.\n\nMaster craftsman Han Wu once embarked on a quest to find the finest ore with which to cast a blackcliff blade. He searched everywhere, until he became involved in a mining accident.\nWhile trapped in the cave, his eyes perceived nothing but an all-engulfing and profoundly disorienting darkness. His ears rang with the thunderous crashing of rocks, as if the foundations of the world itself were caving in.\nIn the aftermath of this ordeal, the craftsman's furnace lay unused. Where flames once burned bright, frigid dust now gathered as the forgotten fantasies of the forge dwindled and died.\nHan Wu's son, Han Ce, read that the earth's core had been sealed off due to a monster infestation, and rushed to inform his father.\nHan Wu was racked with guilt upon hearing the news. He was certain that it was his trip into the mine that had disturbed the dragon from underground and the meteorite from the heavens. He forced himself up from his sickbed, lit the fires of the furnace once more and forged a mighty broadsword.\nWhen it was ready, Han Ce took the sword into the mine shaft. There, on instructions from his father, he erected a shrine as tall as himself and placed the sword inside to ward off evil and rebuke the dragon.\n\nHan Wu died peacefully in his sleep several years later.\nAt the moment of Han Wu's death, a traveler passing by the mine shaft at Mt. Tianheng saw a crimson light shining out from somewhere within the rocks. As the traveler watched on, a hidden shrine appeared and slowly opened.\nThe broadsword inside the shrine shone faintly, as if weeping with bereavement.\nHan Ce went into the mountains that very night to retrieve the blade.\nThe Tianshu of that age personally engraved an inscription upon the blade:\n\"Carves open mountains and tears through the seas, shreds apart clouds and splits the moon.\"",

A shot from this bow takes to the skies like a meteor, challenging both wind and thunder.\n\nThe house of Yun has long since established itself in Liyue as a family of craftsmen. At the time of this bow's inception, the seventh head of the house, Hui, was well-renowned as a member of the Qixing.\nYun Hui had but one child, a daughter, by the name of Huang. As per familial custom, should she marry, her husband would take over as head of house.\nHaving been raised an unyielding martial artist, Huang refused to take this path, and instead took over as the daughter she was, inciting endless gossip amongst the people.\nBut Yun Huang took control at a hard time.\n\nThe continent was troubled. Even the loftiest of peaks and deepest of caves collapsed to a symphony of low roars.\nThe bounty of the earth beneath them became almost unreachable, threatening to bring an end to the legacy of their craft.\nOne night Yun Huang lay awake unable to sleep, tortured by her worries that her family's name would end with her.\nAmidst the sorrow that enveloped her, she could do naught but call upon the heavens and pray for celestial intervention in her desperate situation.\n\nIt was then that Han Ce, who had long since abandoned his family business and wandered the continent, arrived in the village in his craftsman's attire.\nHe handed Huang a small wooden box, within which were the prototype plans his father had revised in his later years. He also took out a bow and said:\n\"As the issue arose from Blackcliff, so too shall it end by Blackcliff. It is said that the house of Yun appreciates archery. Should it please you, give this bow a try.\"\nHuang fired an arrow into the sky. It roared across the heavens like angry thunder, as the sound of the bowstring being released reverberated throughout the mountains.\nAs she watched the clouds flow beneath the moon, she knew that her prayer had been answered.",

Like a needle, it slips between the gaps in an opponent's armor. Like the powers of music and love, it finds its way past people's defenses.\n\nThe designer of the Crescent Pike was said to be able to visualize the fatal flaws in life itself.\nAs if drawn by some mystical power, the pike would fly from her hand towards her opponents' fatal flaws.\n\"Perhaps all that lives waits willingly for death.\"\nSo thought the designer, who could see that which was fatally undefended in each living thing, yet had no such fatal flaws in her own life.\n\nThen she found music, and through music found love. And in love, she found her own fatal flaw.\nIn the end, the pain of finality, which pierced her heart like a needle, finally brought the witch to a realization:\n\"Fatal flaws are born of a fear of death. Fear of death is born of having things, and people, to care about.\"\n\n\"Oh, how I wish to see him but one more time, that thief who can neither be caught nor killed.\"\n\"Oh, how I wish to hear his song but one more time. If I should survive, I shall certainly treat him—\"",

They're all \"Dodocos,\" and they all look the same, after all! So there's no \"you\" or \"me\" for them at all!\nBut only the red, blazing four-leaf clover can let them know the true meaning of \"Dodoco\" and tell each other apart, thus allowing them to play freely with all their friends!\n...At least, that's what my mom says, and she can do just about aaaanything!\nSo, in order to understand what makes a true \"Dodoco,\" they leave their good friends and go to faraway places to make new good friends and become their \"Dodoco,\" too!\nThey'll see all kinds of nice things, hear all kinds of interesting stuff, meet lots of friends... and one day, when their friends are looking at them, at a time when no one expects it — that's when the blazing, sparkling four-leaf clover will appear!\n\nAnd that's why when a furry Dodoco from the Golden Apple Archipelago tumbles into the sea or leaps into the wind before drifting far, far away, that means that a lucky child is about to meet their bestest friend ever!\nThis small, precious book was given by the freest mother in the world to the luckiest daughter in the world. It chronicles the countless adventures that Dodoco had before meeting her, and the adventures that she and Dodoco have had since — bigger and better adventures filled with sparks, splashes, treasures, and lots of friends!",

Yougou came to have the name of an \"evil king,\" and had his great duel against the tengu...\nAll these would light up the hearts of the children of Watatsumi, like pearls from the heavens, like waves under the moon's glow.\nThey will carry the pain of loss away into the churning, salty waters, storing them within radiant pearls.\nMay the stories and sacrifices of the age of gods forever be handed down, along with this emblem of \"pearl and waves.\"\n\nEven if the storm clouds should gather, and even if the violet lightning's ferocity be perilous and unpredictable,\nThe silver moon of Watatsumi shall still pierce through the clouds and scatter forth its light.",

When Huang frantically declined, Yun said this with a smile:\n\"This pearl is nature's very quintessence. Only one whose heart is clear can use it.\"\n\nThanking Yun, Huang took the Eye and wore it on his person, and slowly made his way towards Liyue. Along the way, neither rain nor wind impeded him.\nAs one who sought after the path of the adepti, Huang wandered the lands without rest. Thus, he would often be at the market to buy water and food.\nThe harbor-side streets were a morass of humanity. Yet Huang walked among them as if idle, and was never taken advantage of.\nSome were curious: how could this bookish exorcist take to the city like a fish to water, and never miss a step?\nWhen asked, he replied: \"This Eye trembles at wickedness, and helps me see which hearts are true.\"\n\nThis Eye could reveal human hearts, though no one knows how it worked, causing many to fall back on folktales to explain it.\nSome say that at midnight, you can dimly hear it call out like a mild breeze, or like spring water flowing between scattered stones.\nBoth are reminiscent of the murmuring of demons that feed on wicked thoughts, a common feature of the parables once told by mothers to their children in days gone by.",

Only that which is committed to the page may sparkle and shine for eternity.\n\nEven so, the scale of the library's collection is now a fraction of what it was at its peak.\nFor sadly, the library once burned down in the \"Great Fire of Fall Equinox\" tragedy.\n\nThere is a large sturdy door made of poplar wood in the library basement.\nIt is said the door predates the founding of the library and stood firm against the smoke and flames.\nThe truth is this door stood there long before the Knights of Favonius was ever founded.\nThe Knights of Favonius officially states that the restricted section of the library is housed behind the door.\nBut tales tell of a far more profound secret hidden within.",

You know, warming her hands and feet and all. Very great honor.\"\n\n\"Lady Saiguu would later depart, never to return, and those seniors of mine would also be lost due to various other reasons.\"\n\"And that was how someone as bumbling as I took up the role of \"Miko\" and grew into the person you know today.\"\n\"Thus it was in this way that the unfortunate task of putting a smile on Her Excellency's face fell squarely on my shoulders.\"\n\"The night when I first performed the Kagura dance, I felt the weight of the 'past.'\"\n\nThe tinkling of the bells grew distant, and the great silver kitsune, master and friend, disappeared into the winding river of dreams.\nThe bells sounded again, and the obstinate sandbar loosened and dissolved into the swirling current.\nThe pure white, gentle figure of the past had long drifted into dark memory.\nSo the lone daughter of the great kitsune lineage would take up the Kagura bells, and dance for the vibrant \"now.\"\n\nI knew a young and obstinate tengu warrior, and used the pretext of \"training\" to bluff her into asceticism in the mountains,\nBut sensing her unruly nature, I recommended her to those block-headed Kujou.\nAnd though I once had a competition against an obstinate oni and was defeated by dint of sheer perseverance...\nI did add a few little tricks to make our contest more interesting.\nI corresponded with a half-adeptus from a distant land, and gifted her fresh and supple ocean plants.\nStill, I felt keenly that I could not understand her almost foolish love. Is that not a form of bondage for the adepti?\nThe moonlight sweeps across the imperial garden through branch and petal, alighting upon the empty courtyard.\nThat scene still glows brightly in my shallow heart like countless glimmering jewels...\n\n\"In the short span of these few hundred years, I have walked the earth in many guises.\"\n\"Though I have not had the fortune to have deep relationships with ordinary people, I came to know human beauty deeply.\"\n\"And Her Excellency, whom I might dare to call friend, should have more time yet in this roam.\"\n\"So let us see this imperfect world together and enjoy its obsessions with love and hate, with meetings and partings.\"\n\nWith Her Excellency engrossed in her dream-real of Eternity, someone needed to look out for the common folk.\nTo quell the resentment of the wicked oni Kuroami, I once showed but a hint of the ominous power I wield.\nAnd the great disturbance caused by Kosanta the Bald Tanuki would be made sport of with a little application of magic.\nThe marauding pirate Rinzou, terror of the archipelago, would also be betrayed over some small discordance in plans.\nAnd as for that blank slate, that immortal eccentric...\nI hope \"he\" will find his way and not become a threat to us all.\nThe darkened remains of the swordmaster's soul, the beasts of catastrophe hiding in the sacred forest, they were all wiped out...\nCompared to the dream of Eternity Her Excellency pursues, such things were but fleeting interludes,\nAnd the wait for her to come around seemed to stretch out infinitely, but I knew that time was on our side.\n\n\"I mean, a Euthymia without wind or moon, with lotuses and udumbara that do not wither,\"\n\"I'm sorry, but the loneliness would get to me. I'd be bored to tears.\"\n\"I'd much rather snap off Thunder Sakura branches in a drunken haze and cavort with the impudent youkai.\"\n\"And no, these are not stories of the ancient past, but of a future full of hope.\"\n\"So, You Excellency, might I still have the pleasure of joining you to watch the first pale purple buds that emerge when the snow next melts?\"",

Every young man's rage at injustice must turn to calm. Every passion must be ground into dust by the march of time, before being turned to wild paranoia upon that inverted, ancient tree. Even the branch of the tree of time upon which the great and glorious Reman Republic nested would be cut off in the end, such that the nation founded by the other twin child of the wolves might rule.\nEverything in this world must pass through the doorway of their destruction unto the future kingdom of the Prinzessin. In the silence of her pitch-dark Nachtgarten would they find a place to slumber.\nEven so, when Droctfult fell at the hands of the Beast of the World, having fought for the dreams of a young man and the rain that had yet to fall, and was torn to shred by its claws, the Prinzessin still began to tear up.\n\n\"Hearken well, Ozvaldo Hrafnavins. The Sovereign of the Immernachtreich weepeth not.\"\nShe went on, \"Who among those born into this world are not burdened with sin? When the clock sounds for the time of judgment once more, the skirt of night shall descend once more. Then, the writhing struggles of man and beast trapped within will be naught but a midnight waltz.\"\n\n\"It is as you say, mein Fräulein.\"\n\"Hmph. As well you should know.\"\n\"Well then, mein Fräulein, I wonder if you still recall this tale...\"\n\nTwo of the three bright moons that caused the perfumed sea of the primordial universe to shine and stirred up the beasts of the Arianrhod Realm were shredded by a sword that tore the horizon asunder, left in smithereens too small even for the mystical sight of the Prinzessin.\nOr perhaps this was what happened: the bright moons that once illuminated a universe, brought dreams and song to the sweet sleepers of three worlds, and awakened a deep longing in the beast-herds that wandered betwixt dawn and dusk — they were at last rendered dust. But even so, they too wished to remain within the eternal, shining gaze of the Prinzessin, bringing their subtle light unto more lands still.\n\nIndeed. A Prinzessin does not shed tears.\nThat was merely a natural secretion from her royal eyes, affronted as they were by the untimely intrusion of those impudent grains of sand.\n\n—Volume End—",

The batch number has faded and no records exist to confirm the date of production.\nThe disc represents the cosmos and thus takes a circular form. At the center is a piece of Cor Purum, representing a heavenly body suspended in the firmament.\n\nAfter the great chaos subsided, sinister forces still remained in the world. Thus, people abandoned traditional martial arts and tools and espoused the supernatural arts.\nBut the techniques used in catalyst production were antiquated, having remained unchanged in over a century. Thus, the catalysts of that age were fragile and broke on first use.\nThe thaumaturges flocked to Liyue and pleaded with Yun Hui, head of the house of Yun, to design a new type of catalyst for them.\nYun Hui proceeded to add a catalyst to the then-new series of improved weapon designs known as \"the prototypes.\"\n\nThe disc is made of wood and rare ore. The Cor Purum in the center was a gift from the thaumaturges.\nCor Purum is produced by firing Cor Lapis in an urn for seven days squared (that is, forty-nine days) and then steeping it in fresh water drawn from a mountain spring for a further seven days squared.\nThe dual purification of fire and water renders Cor Purum unbreakable, and the thaumaturges also believe it allows the stone to act as a vessel for primordial cosmic energy. A catalyst with Cor Purum at its core can channel cosmic energy with the turning of the disc. Twelve full turns works the energy into its purest form.\n\nYun Hui observed that the Cor Purum had a warm, golden glow like that of amber. After discussion with the thaumaturges, he proposed to name the catalyst \"Prototype Amber.\"\nThereafter, all catalysts made in Liyue were modeled on Yun Hui's prototype.",

All you will see when it is swung are blinding flashes of light, powerful enough to devour the clouds and blot out the moon.\n\nAfter the great disaster, the Yun family forge joined forces with master craftsman Han Wu to find a way to push past the constraints of contemporary blade design and revolutionize their craft.\nThus was born a new series of weapon models, simply named \"the prototypes.\" The first greatsword built using the new design was unusually understated in its final appearance.\nThe underwhelming sight of dull, blotchy gold masked the weapon's true strength. While not much to look at, any who cared to try it would discover that it was weighty but not unwieldy.\n\nHan Wu, the master craftsman who forged the weapon, traveled north through the night to hand the sword over to a martial artist who followed the chivalric code.\nThe martial artist inspected the blade closely before trialing it. The blade howled like the wind and in an instant decimated the entire bamboo forest. It was a rare sight to behold.\n\nThe martial artist said to Han Wu, \"This blade is endowed with the elegance of antiquity. It is of equal value both as a weapon and an ornament.\"\n\"Such a fine creation possessed of both scale and subtlety is worthy of a prestigious name. May it be known as Archaic.\"\nDue to its unparalleled strength, this sword subsequently became the model for thousands of greatswords in Liyue.",

The batch number has faded and no records exist to confirm the date of production.\nA swirling cloud motif is etched into the body of the blade, which gives it a faint golden glow in the sunlight as it swings through the air.\n\nIt is said that the bladesmiths behind this weapon reached the extent of their abilities and were forced to innovate.\nYun Hui, head of the house of Yun's family forge, approached renowned craftsman Han Wu. With the combined expertise from both sides, Han Wu drew up designs for a new series of weapons, simply named \"the prototypes.\"\nThe very first sword made following this design already had the feel of a formidable weapon.\n\nWhile trying out the sword at Mt. Tianheng, Han Wu accidentally dropped it on the ground.\nThe sword responded by unleashing a swirling tornado of energy that cut a twelve-inch-deep hole into the solid mountain rock.\nHan Wu took it as a sign from the heavens. He declared, \"This sword shall be named Rancour, destroyer of rocks.\"\n\nThis sword shakes mountains at their foundations and possesses the power of a thousand peaks in its tip.\nThis sword that cuts through rocks like butter became the basis for all subsequent swords made in Liyue.",

The batch number has faded and no records exist to confirm the date of production.\nThe pole is made of black steel inlaid with gold. A lightning motif runs along the body, featuring streaks of lightning interspersed with stars. The addition of gold leaf gives it an exquisite finish.\n\nBy the time the monster threat was quelled, the remaining troops were few and far between, and each joined the civilian community where they were based. Though peace now prevailed, it sparked a martial arts renaissance that spread throughout the land.\nDemand for all kinds of weaponry spiked, especially for superior quality items, and manufacturers could not keep pace. To find a solution, Yun Hui of the house of Yun met with master craftsman Han Wu and the two conducted intensive research behind closed doors.\nBy the time they emerged, both men's beards had grown by twelve inches. Their new weapon designs, \"the prototypes,\" were finally ready to revolutionize weaponry manufacturing in Liyue. It was time to do away with the shackles of the past that plagued their craft.\n\nThe first pole built to the new specifications had a black-and-gold appearance. The spike at the tip was two inches longer than the previous standard. It was truly a deadly weapon, but one with a composed and commanding presence.\nIt was left to bask overnight in the moonlight. At the first light of dawn, the tip shone with the cold, piercing light of a star against the dim sky.\n\nAt this ethereal sight, Yun Hui's mind was flooded with memories of his father's glory, for his father's name made reference to the stars. Greatly moved, he decided to dedicate the weapon to his father's memory.\nFor this reason the weapon became known as \"Starglitter\" among later practitioners of the halberd arts in Liyue.",

Yougou,\nFeared the ominous power of the Pestle, and would not come forth to face the Lion King!\n\n...Of course, the children never believed such tales.\nStill, the Otogi King truly was very strong. Even seven men together could not push him out of a dohyou.\nAnd when he saw children hankering after fruit they could not reach, he would kick the tree and send the melons plummeting down.\nThat said, he did once kick the whole tree down, and was chased into the mountains by an old man.\nHe also once brought the children to crash an official autumn leaf-watching concert,\nCrying in a loud voice \"The Otogi Kongou Lion King is here. Demons beware!\"\nHe then wrestled with the petite oni who just happened to be in the mood for a tussle... The results were too tragic to watch.\n\nBut if this was all the King had, to the point where he was never given the right to wear the Shogun's colors,\nHow could he, the children said, possibly bring those youkai of song to heel?\n\n\"Hah! I was just suffering from the chills after a long night of drinking, that's all!\"\nEven as the Otogi King made his excuses, he did not forget to laugh heartily.\nWas he just shameless, or did he really believe that he could win? No one could say...\n\n\"This time, I'll definitely cut off the horns of those monsters,\"\n\"And bring them back for ya. That'll show you the might of the Otogi Kongou Lion King!\"\n\"Those creatures from beyond the ocean? Pfft! Easy pickings, I tell ya!\"\n\n\"So yeah, shoo, shoo, follow the fox envoy to go hide in a corner and stuff.\"\n\"I'll swing by later. We'll have ourselves a few wrestling bouts then, eh?\"\n\nEven as he said that, the children remembered how the dainty oni had huffed softly,\nHurling the roaring, onrushing Otogi King into the sky...\n\nLater, the oni who had wrestled with the Otogi King would flee after having her arm and horn cut off,\nWhile the Great Tengu would no longer appear before humans, living in hermitage in the mountains and woods.\nAnd so, the empty boasts behind this greatsword came true in the end,\nThough the wandering, eccentric Otogi Kongou Lion King himself never returned again.\nEven later on, the Lavender Melon tree that he kicked down would, with careful tending, once again bear fruit.",

When people questioned him, he laughed and said:\n\"I know myself. What is wine and song to me? Worry not. Once the sea and winds are right...\"\nBut he would never finish that statement. He would only raise his mug, and call for all around to have another drink.\n\nThen, the day when the sea and winds came together arrived at last, and the stern of the great vessel rode them as it sailed.\nDeep into the misty sea it went, far across the darkening waves, into the ocean that teemed with sea creatures.\nAnd at last, neither the singing skipper nor his ship would ever return to the harbor ringed by mountains.\nAfter many days, the corpse of a sea monster from the deep was beached upon the shore by the waves.\nBrilliant white bone shone out from a great gash torn into it by a greatsword. Its blood had long been washed clean.\n\n\"When the sea and winds are right, I will go forth to sea and avenge her, O maiden charmed by the tidal song.\"\n\"So what if I sleep with the fishes? That way, I will be able to send my sea shanties into the deep where she dwells.\"\n\nToday, the seas are no longer plagued by giant creatures that emerge from the storm and rain down devastation upon the waves.\nThe practice of mounting skeletons of sea monsters onto the bows of ships has also been lost with their extinction.\nBut when one sails far abroad, sometimes one can still hear the spine-chilling sound of thunder rumbling in the depths...",

And yet, to this day, many in Liyue hold steadfastly to their belief in the esoteric talents of the master craftsman Kunwu.\nSomeone once plucked up the courage to ask the aging craftsman what his secret was. The eccentric old man laughed off the nonsensical notion of his mystical capabilities:\n\"Pfft! 'Twas purely the product of prolonged polishing!\"\n\nBut his apprentice revealed a different story when asked about it in private: Just as Kunwu finished polishing the Solar Pearl, the splendor of the heavens shone down and a crimson moon filled the sky.\nBut did this phenomenon mean that Kunwu had indeed received divine assistance in his craft? Or was it a measure of his own accomplishment that his lofty ambitions had sufficed to send waves through the firmament and even elicit a response from the heavenly bodies?",

Where the music from this instrument leads, death shall surely follow.\n\nAfter the Wanderer's Troupe disbanded, the harp's strings were cut with a dull blade, creating ear-piercing noises.\nOnly the bowstring now remains. The instrument's lofty melodies are lost, but it remains a deadly weapon.\n\nThe Wanderer's Troupe could make birds fall from the sky, sometimes with the tune of the harp, sometimes with the arrows that followed the tune through the air.\nJust like the wind that elopes with the harp's tune and the flowers that grow on Starsnatch Cliff, the harpist was both playful and determined.\nAfter the uprising failed, the Wanderer's Troupe disbanded and its members fled.\nThe harpist stayed till the end, deftly plucking the instrument's strings and raining down a torrent of arrows to protect his comrades. He played till he exhausted his repertoire, and his arrows.\n\nThe harpist was from the magnificent and enchanting land of Fontaine. He had left to travel the world in search of his true destiny.\nIt is said that all the ladies of the Court of Fontaine wailed with grief when they heard the tragic news that he had left without saying goodbye.\n\nThe story is that he fell in love with a humble Mondstadt woman, but she was then selected for the miserable fate of Ludi Harpastum princess.\nIt is claimed that he had no regrets about dying anonymously in a foreign land.\nThe only thing he regretted was finally discovering true love, only to never have the chance to sing another love song.",

But in the good news, he won that unmatched bow.\n\n\"Behold, Konbumaru, this is Tengu archery. Watch and learn!\"\nHe was given this rather ridiculous nickname, but ultimately, he witnessed the Tengu's form.\nSoaring through the clouds unfettered, unleashing thunderbolts with every bowstring's pulse...\nIt was a true, unreserved dance of death. Fierce and unpredictable, elegant and beautiful.\n\nMany years later, he was no longer a servant boy, and he had grasped both some archery and swordsmanship.\nHe was referred to the Shogunate through a recommendation letter from his impatient master.\nIn the years under the Shogun, his martial skills improved greatly, and he made many friends and enemies.\nStill, his hobby of unrestrained wanderlust had not changed. On the contrary, with the Tengu's great bow, he became yet more fearless.\n\n\"Let's make a wager this time, shall we? Hmm. Right, then. This bow shall be my wager.\"\n\"I bet on the mightiest bow in the world that I will return here alive.\"\n\"I'll leave it here with you for now. If I, Takamine, lose our bet, you can keep the bow.\"\n\"After all, you've inherited the essence of my archery techniques. You'll be able to make good use of it.\"\n\"But if I win...\"\n\nWhen disaster swept in from across the distant sea, the samurai and the obstinate shrine maiden had a mutual wager.\nThey bet on his safe return from the abyss against the inscribed bow bestowed by the Shogun.\n\nWhen the dark venom sank deep into the earth and peace returned, the swordsman did not come back.\nThe Shogun's bestowed bow was given to the shrine maiden as her prize for winning their great wager.\nLater, in the forest where the Kitsune Saiguu would no longer appear, in the promised meeting place,\nThe lone returnee who came stumbling back from the abyss finally met the shrine maiden again, though by now she could no longer be called young.\nDull eyes stained with dried blood and tears regained their radiance, but were pierced through by a barbed arrow glowing with power.",

But there is one story that they all believe.\nThey believe that Rex Lapis once wielded a spear that pierced the rainbow, pinning the churning vortex that had once terrorized the oceans in the center of the deep sea.\n\nLegends have it that since then, one can often see dolphins and whales congregate about that patch of ocean, singing.\nSome hold that they mourn for the god that they revered, and sing many a winding dirge for it.\nOthers claim that they do so in awe of Rex Lapis' great power, that he could indeed pierce the rainbow's arc and bring down the sun.\n\nBut folk legend also holds this.\nThat one day, the vortex, consigned to a dead stillness by the Lord of Geo's divine spear, will once again begin to wake.\nWhen the wind once again brings the stench of the depths onshore, that will be the omen of a hurricane as large as a nine-headed hydra.\nWho, then, will be able to subdue That Which Lies in the Deep?",

It is unique in that the edge closest to the wielder has been left dull.\nThe dull edge is said to have been used as the hilt, enabling the wielder to switch forms by constantly shifting hand positions in combat.\n\nThough it is rarely acknowledged, this greatsword was in fact a foreign bladesmith's labor of love.\nThe bladesmith knew himself to be dull of wits, and was anxious that this blade should not follow suit. Hence, he worked painstakingly on sharpening and balancing his beloved blade.\nSparks flew as the bladesmith worked through many sleepless nights.\nThe sword was recast and re-tempered countless times.\nAll the while his mind was consumed with the hope of his lover's return, as well as his untold anxiety for her well-being.\n\n\"After the war is over...\"\nThe bladesmith would ponder briefly, each time he paused for breath.\n\"Will this blade still be of use to her?\"\n\"Will she even make it home safely?\"\nThese thoughts would linger in his mind for but a moment before he cast them aside and refocused his full attention on the blade.\nIndulging irresolvable anxieties was a futile endeavor — better to focus his faculties on creating the perfect welcome-home gift.\n\nFinally, the day came when the triumphant expeditionary force entered the city gates, their monstrous foes defeated at last.\nBut the bladesmith had not had time to carve his lover's name onto the blade's body.\nWith no time to lose, he grabbed the sword and rushed to meet his lover on the occasion of her return.\nUnfortunately, what would transpire next was to be an unbearable anticlimax.\n\nAs the warrior removed her helmet, long, soft hair flowed down. She was growing her hair out, and hence would never need to wield a blade again for the rest of her days.\nMeanwhile, she had brought her lover a gift, too: A shiny new hunting bow.\n\"Romance is dead! I wasted all these years making you this greatsword, and now you don't even need it!\"\nThe bladesmith was thoroughly miserable and would not stop complaining about the unfairness of it all. But his efforts had by no means been in vain — at least he had finally succeeded in making a blade of the very finest quality.",

One fine day — When? No one can say — he appeared like a ghost in our slum.\"\n\"He sings, he drinks, he wanders the streets, he passes the roofs and terraces by. But everyone knows he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.\"\n\"The sword by his side was a great house's pride, and he stole it from where it'd been lain, and the bow so black that he wears on his back fires never once in vain.\"\n\"His matchless skill rings chill in the night like a comet's flashing tail, and his strides are as light as Favonius' flight, and the leaves that behold him quail.\"\n\"He could slake the entire Cider Lake, were it all filled with Death After Noon. And then he'd creep right up to those pigs at midnight, while they're all fast asleep in their rooms.\"\n\"He robs the rich and pays the poor, he blows noble farts away, he throws a spark into the dark, and night is pierced by day.\"\n\n\"The maidens all dream of the gentleman thief, they pine after him from their windows, but sad to say, he passes not that way, he prefers a pint with his fellows.\"\n\"Till on one day (or was it dusk?) in a mansion he ran amok, took he with him a thief's full due, and an extra silver cup.\"\n\"Left he silently in the moon's silver light, when fey were his eyes set ablaze, he lifted them nigh to a warm window bright, and upon a lovely face he gazed.\"\n\"Her eyes they shone like sapphire stones, so blue did they gleam in the dark, and the thief glanced up to the gem in his cup, and he thought them the same in his heart.\"\n\"Losing no time, the thief made his climb, and prying the gem from its place, he gave it to her, and a bashful smile stirred, and crept up upon her face.\"\n\"When at last they toppled the indolent nobles, they left, distant lands to explore, and so the song says, they warmed each other's days with light forevermore.\"\n\nThe story ends here. In the latter days of righteous governance, there are none left who sing of the gentleman thief, nor are such thieves needed anymore.\nWine and swords, maidens and heroes, a carefree opening and a happy ending, this vulgar sort of tale tends to be popular with the people.\nFor no matter how the real story went, or how the two truly ended up, wine and songs brim with hope.\nThey give the unfortunate a little courage to face tomorrow, and stand up to the powers that oppress them...",
