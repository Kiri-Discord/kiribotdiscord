It is said that it blooms most enchantingly where much blood was spilled.\nThough it is very rare and expensive, this plant is regarded as ominous, and thus is little purchased. Rumor has it that these plants are watered using blood. The bloodier and more brutal the battlefield, the more lovely the dendrobium blooms shall be. Inazumans believe that the souls of the fallen shall follow the winding paths of the bloodied dendrobiums into the next life, thus rejoining the eternal elemental cycle. But as for those who doubt or are perplexed by \"eternity,\" they shall be shackled to the earth, becoming another enchantingly red flower amid the vermillion fields.",

Her sword-arm and one horn would be cloven, and she would flee from the city into the forest like a wounded beast. There, they say that she was taken for some unknown monster and slain by the tengu, or perhaps by the Shuumatsuban — or perhaps by a scion of the Iwakura Clan training deep in the mountains, for her features had been twisted by hatred and the agony of her wounds. Or perhaps she even met the oni-masked, sword-bearing doll near the corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her life's journey.\nFew among those who fought against the abyss in those days were spared pitch-dark dreams. Those who slew monsters and then became them were hardly the minority. The border between worlds grows fragile, and corruption of this kind is perhaps not merely monodirectional.",
